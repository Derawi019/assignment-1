    <strong> Re: Eileen Dover university application</strong>


    <p>
        Dear Eileen,
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as
        part<br>
        of your <u>PhD</u> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if
        you<br>
        could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    <ul type="dot">
        <li> First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>

    </ul>
    Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br>
    You can find more information about <a href="">important university dates</a> on our website.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall<br>
    somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
    by are as follows, in order of priority:<br>
    1. Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
    (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)<br>
    2. Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience
    size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>)<br>
    3. HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores<br>
    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
    research<br>
    to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>

    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br>
        Polynesian chicken dance
        <dd>
            A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance
            around<br> in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful"

        </dd>

        Icelandic brownian shuffle
        <br>
        <dd>
            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
            involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around
            inimperceptibly<br> tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this
            dance
            inspired<br> modern styles such as Twerking.
        </dd>
        <br>
        Arctic robot dance
        <dd>
            An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
            discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by
            inhabitants<br>
            of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>
            because they were really cold.
        </dd>

    <p>
        Yours sincerely,<br><br>
